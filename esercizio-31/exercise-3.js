// In this exercises something goes wrong. Even though we have created a copy of person1, modifying the property city of person2 also changes the value for person1. This happens because we have created a shallow copy. How can we fix the code in order to be able modify the values of person2 without changing the values of person1?


const person1 = {
  id: 1,
  firstName: 'Mario',
  lastName: 'Rossi',
  age: 25,
  address: {
    state: 'Italy',
    city: 'Rome',
    street: 'Via Romano, 12'
  }
};

const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person1));
person2.address.city = 'Milan';

console.log(person1);
console.log(person2);
